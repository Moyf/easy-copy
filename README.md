## ü§î Why use this plugin

### Inline Code ‚Äî Just the Text Inside!
I often use `inline code` for debug commands or keywords and need to quickly copy the content inside the `` ` `` symbols.
In the past, I had to carefully select the text wrapped inside... which was quite tedious!
**I want to directly copy the text inside the inline code**
So I created this plugin - just place your cursor inside the inline code, and copy with a single keystroke!

Just like this:

![demo](assets/demo-copy.gif)

> It also supports copying bold text, highlighted text, italic text.
> (If you don't need these features, you can disable them in the settings)



### Heading Links ‚Äî Display Just the Heading Text!
As for heading links, that's another long-standing issue.
Default heading links display as a long text string, but I wanted to **show only the heading text** ‚Äî using it as the Display Text!
So I added this feature to the plugin as well:

![copy-heading](assets/copy-heading.gif)

It would copy the heading text as the display text:

```md
From:
[[note-name#heading-text]]

To:
[[note-name#heading-text|heading-text]]
```

The difference looks like this:

![heading-compare](assets/heading-compare.png)

### Block Links ‚Äî They're Just Block Links!
This works almost the same as heading links, so I implemented it too!

## ü™Ñ How to Use

1. The simplest way is to use a keyboard shortcut (I use `Ctrl+Alt+C`, you can customize it in settings) ‚Äî just place your cursor inside the specific text and press the hotkey to copy. ![hotkey](assets/hotkey.png)
2. The plugin also supports right-click menu operations (which can be disabled in settings if not needed)![menu-item](assets/menu-item.png)

3. Of course, you can also trigger it by searching for "Contextual Copy" in the command palette ‚Äî it works the same as the hotkey!
